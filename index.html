<h1>How does writing CSS differ from writing HTML</h1>

<p>As we write CSS there are the type of questionswe might ask ourselves:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Should we layout the text in a single or double columns?</li>
      <li>Should we use a different front color for the header?</li>
      <li>How should the very same content appear differently ona desktopvs. a mobile device?</li>
    </ul>
  
    
    
<p>All ofthe questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations. There are perspectives of the presentational layer (CSS)</p>

<li>Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write </li>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Does the order of the tiems within a list matter?</li>
  <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
  <li>Is this the most important header inthe wholeHTML document?</li>
</ul

<p>The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are the perspectives of the content layer (HTML) </p>
<p>When we write CSS we focus on estheticand function considerations. When we write HTML we focus on strcuture, hierarchy, and meaning </p>
